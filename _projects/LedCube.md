This was a fun project where I tried to make a led cube. 
At first I wanted to build a 5x5x5 cube, but after building 2 layers it turned out that it was to much work. 
The electronics also couldn't really handle having so many leds in series.
This project uses the Arduino and the [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) library for RGB leds.
